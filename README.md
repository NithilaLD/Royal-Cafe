## Overview
The **Royal Cafe Restaurant Website** is a full-stack web application developed as a group project for our first-year Web Development module. The purpose of this project is to apply the fundamentals of front-end and back-end web technologies in building a professional, responsive website for a fictional restaurant - Royal Cafe. The website provides a smooth user experience where customers can browse the menu, learn about the restaurant, view photo galleries, and contact the restaurant through a functional form connected to a PHP back-end.
